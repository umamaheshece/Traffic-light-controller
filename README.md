# Traffic-light-controller
This project was aimed at solving real-world urban traffic issues by simulating timed light transitions for RED, GREEN, and YELLOW signals. The goal was to implement clean RTL logic, simulate accurate timing, and observe real-time transitions using waveform and console monitoring.
